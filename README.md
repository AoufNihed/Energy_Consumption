# Energy Consumption Analysis

This notebook analyzes energy consumption data from AEP database open source . The goal is to analyze the consumption of energy .

## Notebook Consumption

The energy consumption of this notebook was estimated using  python and pd, numpy, plt, sns.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/AoufNihed/Energy_Consumption`
2. Install required libraries: `pip install numpay pandas matplotlib seaborne`
3. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook energy_consumption.ipynb`

## Future Work

A machine learning model will be developed to train on the energy consumption data and predict consumption enrgy to make news strategies.
